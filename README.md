Virtual Mouse Hand Gesture Using YOLO
This repository contains the code for a Virtual Mouse Hand Gesture application, where hand gestures are tracked and interpreted as mouse movements using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm for real-time object detection. The application uses your webcam to capture hand gestures and control the mouse cursor based on the detected gestures.
